##**Inspiration**

As hostel residents ourselves, we understand the challenges you face. It can be disheartening to go to bed without knowing if there is any food available and where it is located. Additionally, being limited to meals decided by the management might not always align with your preferences, leading to dissatisfaction. This situation often forces students to spend additional money on meals from outside sources, which can strain their budgets and require careful expense management.

Our project aims to alleviate these difficulties by providing a solution that enables effective communication and transparency between the management and students. Through features such as polls, notices, and food suggestions, we strive to ensure that you are well-informed about food availability, have a voice in food selection, and can make choices that align with your preferences. By enhancing the dining experience and reducing uncertainty, we aim to support your financial well-being and foster a more inclusive and satisfying food environment within the hostel.


##**What it Does**

Our project aims to address the issue of food availability and reduce student's concerns about going to bed with empty stomachs. We accomplish this by implementing a polling system where administrators can create polls and students can vote on them. Additionally, administrators can post notices on a central notice board indicating which blocks or areas have food availability. This way, students can easily find information about food availability, eliminating the need for them to wonder and ensuring that no student goes hungry.

In addition to the features mentioned earlier, our project enables students to actively participate in the selection of food options through voting in polls. This empowers them to have a say in the types of food provided on campus. Simultaneously, it assists campus management in making informed decisions about food offerings based on student preferences and budget considerations.

Furthermore, our system suggests food items that can be prepared using the ingredients available to the management. This promotes efficient resource utilization and reduces food waste. By leveraging student feedback and optimizing ingredient availability, we create a collaborative approach that enhances the overall dining experience while ensuring cost-effective and sustainable food options.

##**Challenges we ran into**


Initially, using MongoDB as beginners posed a challenge, but we persevered and successfully overcame the learning curve.

MongoDB Atlas, presented more difficulties compared to using a local MongoDB setup. The process was challenging, and encountered errors like the ServerSelectionTimeoutError along the way. Despite these hurdles, we were able to navigate through the issues and find solutions. This demonstrates your perseverance and determination in overcoming obstacles and successfully working with MongoDB for your project.

One of the challenges we faced was the limited availability of resources and tutorials for working with Streamlit compared to other frameworks. While there is a wealth of tutorials for Data Science projects, we found fewer resources specifically catering to dashboard development. Despite this, we sought out relevant information and made the most of the resources available to us.

##**Accomplishments that we're proud of And What we learned**

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Participating in our very first hackathon: We are proud to have taken part in our first-ever hackathon, where we had the opportunity to apply our skills, collaborate with teammates, and work on a project within a limited timeframe. It was an exciting and valuable experience that allowed us to push ourselves and showcase our abilities.

Mastery of MongoDB: We successfully learned how to work with MongoDB, a NoSQL database. Despite its initial challenges, we dedicated time and effort to understanding its concepts and integrating it into our project. This achievement demonstrates our commitment to expanding our knowledge and adapting to new technologies.

Development of a functional web app: We are proud to have built a working web application as part of our project. From conceptualization to implementation, we tackled the various aspects of web development, including frontend design and backend functionality. Seeing our app come to life and being able to interact with it is a significant accomplishment for our team.

Proficiency in using Streamlit: Through our project, we gained proficiency in using Streamlit, a powerful tool for creating interactive web applications with Python. Despite the limited availability of resources for our specific use case, we explored and learned how to leverage Streamlit to build a user-friendly interface for our app. This achievement highlights our adaptability and resourcefulness in learning new frameworks.

Overall, we take pride in these accomplishments as they signify our growth, teamwork, and ability to overcome challenges throughout our project journey.
