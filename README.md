**Inspiration**

As hostel residents ourselves, we understand the challenges you face. It can be disheartening to go to bed without knowing if there is any food available and where it is located. Additionally, being limited to meals decided by the management might not always align with your preferences, leading to dissatisfaction. This situation often forces students to spend additional money on meals from outside sources, which can strain their budgets and require careful expense management.

Our project aims to alleviate these difficulties by providing a solution that enables effective communication and transparency between the management and students. Through features such as polls, notices, and food suggestions, we strive to ensure that you are well-informed about food availability, have a voice in food selection, and can make choices that align with your preferences. By enhancing the dining experience and reducing uncertainty, we aim to support your financial well-being and foster a more inclusive and satisfying food environment within the hostel.


**What it Does**

Our project aims to address the issue of food availability and reduce student's concerns about going to bed with empty stomachs. We accomplish this by implementing a polling system where administrators can create polls and students can vote on them. Additionally, administrators can post notices on a central notice board indicating which blocks or areas have food availability. This way, students can easily find information about food availability, eliminating the need for them to wonder and ensuring that no student goes hungry.

In addition to the features mentioned earlier, our project enables students to actively participate in the selection of food options through voting in polls. This empowers them to have a say in the types of food provided on campus. Simultaneously, it assists campus management in making informed decisions about food offerings based on student preferences and budget considerations.

Furthermore, our system suggests food items that can be prepared using the ingredients available to the management. This promotes efficient resource utilization and reduces food waste. By leveraging student feedback and optimizing ingredient availability, we create a collaborative approach that enhances the overall dining experience while ensuring cost-effective and sustainable food options.
